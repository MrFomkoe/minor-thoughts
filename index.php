      <p> The Minor Thoughts is a two-piece indie/alternative rock band from Riga, Latvia. </p>

      <p>Initially, the band was formed in 2018 by drummer Dmitry Dvoryanov and singer/guitarist Roman Ponomarjov.</p>

      <p>The band has been playing British indie rock with some elements of alternative rock. </p>

      <p>Later bassist Kristina Monahova joined the band. After that, the band played several shows in clubs in Riga under the name Nekkid and was warmly welcomed by the audience. </p>

      <p>In April 2019 the place of bassist was taken by Arturs Eimanis and the band continued live performances, as well as, took up the recording of a single "Johnnie Walker". Unfortunately, the record has never been finished. </p>

      <p>In 2022 Roman and Dmitry decided to change the sound of the band to more electronic music and heavier rock. </p>

      <p>Everything else is the future...</p>
